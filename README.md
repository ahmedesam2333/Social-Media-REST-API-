## Overview

A full-featured social networking REST API built with TypeScript and Node.js. Users can register, build profiles, publish posts, interact through comments and likes, connect with friends, and chat in real time. The backend is organized into focused modules — auth, profiles, feed, comments, social connections, and cloud storage — each backed by clean service layers, strict validation, and typed interfaces throughout.

**Core flow:**

1. A user registers, verifies their email via OTP, and receives a JWT session
2. They build a profile with image and cover uploads stored on AWS S3
3. They publish posts, control visibility, and interact with others' content via likes and comments
4. They send and accept friend requests to build their social graph
5. They open real-time chat sessions powered by Socket.io
6. Admins manage roles and accounts via a protected dashboard

## Implemented Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Request Validation

**Express Application Bootstrap**
- Initialized Express application with a modular middleware stack and centralized routing via `app.controller.ts`
- Configured global security middleware: Helmet, CORS, and rate limiting (200 req/hr per IP)
- Established foundational error handling and request processing pipelines

**Auth Routes & Controller**
- Registered `/auth/signup` and `/auth/login` endpoints in the auth controller
- Integrated request validation middleware at the route level, validating before handlers execute
- Structured auth workflows for user registration and credential-based authentication

**Generic Request Validation Middleware**
- Built a reusable `validateRequest` middleware that validates any combination of `body`, `params`, or `query` against Zod schemas
- Centralized validation logic at the request boundary — invalid input is rejected before reaching controllers
- Returns `400 Validation Error` responses with detailed field-level error messages

**Shared Field Schemas**
- Defined reusable validation schemas for common fields (`email`, `password`, `username`, `phone`) in the validation middleware
- Schemas are composed into endpoint-specific validators, eliminating redundancy across modules
- Email validation via RFC 5322 standard; password enforces uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character requirements

**Signup & Login Validation Schemas**
- `signupSchema` enforces username as exactly two words (first and last name) via `superRefine` custom checks
- `signupSchema` validates email uniqueness, strong password policy, and Egyptian phone format (`010 / 011 / 012 / 015`)
- `loginSchema` validates email and password presence and format
- `ISignupBodyInputsDto` inferred dynamically from Zod schema — eliminates manual type duplication and keeps types in sync

**Global Error Handling**
- Centralized `globalErrorHandling` middleware using custom exception classes for structured error responses
- Conditional stack trace exposure: stack traces are included in `DEV` environment; suppressed in `PROD` for security
- Uniform JSON error responses across all routes with consistent error formatting

## Database Models

### User — `src/DB/models/User.model.ts`

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `_id` | ObjectId | MongoDB primary key |
| `firstName` | String | Required · 2–25 chars |
| `lastName` | String | Required · 2–25 chars |
| `username` | Virtual | Getter/setter that combines first and last name |
| `email` | String | Required · Unique index |
| `password` | String | Required · bcrypt hashed |
| `phone` | String | Optional · Egyptian format validation |
| `address` | String | Optional |
| `gender` | String | `male` / `female` · Default: `male` |
| `role` | String | `user` / `admin` · Default: `user` |
| `confirmedAt` | Date | Email verification timestamp |
| `confirmEmailOtp` | String | Hashed OTP for email verification · removed after confirmation |
| `resetPasswordOtp` | String | Hashed OTP for password reset · removed after reset |
| `changeCredentialsTime` | Date | Updated on password change · invalidates prior sessions |
| `createdAt` | Date | Auto-generated timestamp |
| `updatedAt` | Date | Auto-updated on any modification |

**Enums**

| Enum | Values |
|---|---|
| `RoleEnum` | `user`, `admin` |
| `GenderEnum` | `male`, `female` |

## Security Design

- **Helmet** — Secure HTTP headers applied to every response
- **CORS** — Enabled globally
- **Rate Limiting** — 200 requests per hour per IP; excess requests return `429` with a JSON error body
- **Zod** — Strict schema validation on every request boundary; unknown fields are rejected outright
- **Password Policy** — Minimum 8 characters; requires uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character
- **Phone Validation** — Egyptian numbers only (`010 / 011 / 012 / 015`)
- **Environment-Aware Error Reporting** — Error stack traces are exposed only in `DEV` mode; production responses reveal no internal details

---

## API Reference

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:5000`

> 🔒 Protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
>
> All routes return `400 Validation Error` on invalid input — omitted per endpoint for brevity.
